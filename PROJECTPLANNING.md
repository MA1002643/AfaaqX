## Website Behaviour

#### Login

When users access the web application, they can log in or register (or simply close this window to navigate around the app). Business owners must register using an email address ending in @ad.amc.pk to access the dashboard (administrators will have full access). Whether you log in as an admin, staff, or user, you should receive a second authentication prompt via Microsoft Authenticator or a code sent to your email or phone.

I want the web app to be managed with access control. If the user uses @ad.amc.uk as the username, the admin dashboard should be visible (with full control). If a user account is created with @amc.pk for regular staff, they should be able to perform only the tasks mentioned above. If a customer logs in or registers, the dashboard should not be visible.
